# Advanced GitHub Copilot Features

## Overview
GitHub Copilot offers sophisticated features beyond basic code completion. This guide covers advanced capabilities, integrations, and optimization techniques for power users.

## GitHub Copilot Chat

### Core Capabilities
GitHub Copilot Chat brings conversational AI directly into your development environment, enabling natural language interactions for complex programming tasks.

#### Chat Commands and Slash Commands
```
/explain - Explain the selected code
/fix - Suggest fixes for problems in code
/tests - Generate unit tests for the selected code
/doc - Generate documentation for code
/refactor - Suggest refactoring improvements
```

### Advanced Chat Techniques

#### Context-Aware Conversations
```
# Example conversation flow:
User: "I have a Python function that processes user data but it's slow with large datasets"
Copilot: "I can help optimize that. Can you show me the function?"
User: [shares code]
Copilot: "I see several optimization opportunities. Here are vectorized approaches using pandas..."
```

## Customization and Configuration

### Settings and Preferences
```json
// VS Code settings.json example
{
    "github.copilot.enable": {
        "*": true,
        "yaml": false,
        "plaintext": false
    },
    "github.copilot.editor.enableAutoCompletions": true,
    "github.copilot.advanced": {
        "secret_key": "example",
        "length": 500
    }
}
```

### Language-Specific Configuration
- **Python**: Enhanced support for data science libraries
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Framework-aware suggestions
- **Java**: Enterprise pattern recognition
- **C#**: .NET ecosystem integration

### Team and Organization Settings
- **Centralized Policies**: Organization-wide configuration
- **Content Exclusions**: Repository-specific restrictions
- **Usage Analytics**: Team productivity insights

## Performance Optimization

### Maximizing Suggestion Quality
1. **File Organization**: Keep related code together
2. **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive, consistent names
3. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date comments
4. **Code Structure**: Follow established patterns

### Reducing Latency
- **Network Optimization**: Stable internet connection
- **IDE Performance**: Keep IDE responsive
- **File Size Management**: Break large files into modules

## Advanced Prompt Engineering

### Sophisticated Prompting Techniques

#### Contextual Anchoring
```python
# Complex data processing pipeline for financial analytics
# Input: daily stock prices from multiple exchanges
# Output: risk-adjusted portfolio recommendations
# Requirements: handle missing data, calculate Sharpe ratios, support multiple currencies
# Performance: process 10k+ securities in under 30 seconds
class PortfolioOptimizer:
```

#### Multi-Modal Prompting
```typescript
// React component integrating with GraphQL API
// Apollo Client for state management
// Material-UI for styling
// TypeScript for type safety
// Responsive design for mobile and desktop
interface StockDashboardProps {
```

#### Domain-Specific Context
```java
// Spring Boot microservice for payment processing
// Implements PCI DSS compliance requirements
// Uses Circuit Breaker pattern for external API calls
// Supports multiple payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
// Includes comprehensive audit logging
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/payments")
public class PaymentController {
```

## Collaboration Features

### Team Productivity
- **Shared Contexts**: Consistent coding patterns across team
